1. Data Merging Basics
```
A. inner join:
df.merge(df,on='col_name',suffixes=('_cen','_ward')).... 'on' will merge common column[left dataframe and right dataframe] + 'suffix' will change other same table conlumn name
ps. wards.loc[wards['ward'] == '1', 'ward'] = '____'..... loc can access row_name and column_name
ps. to select specific row, we can use 3 steps:
a.select column
b.set condition
c.use result to select rows

B. One-to-many relationships
one-to-one : Every row in the left table is related to only one row in the right table
one-to-many:  Every row in the left table is related to several rows in the right table

C. Merging multiple DataFrames

```
